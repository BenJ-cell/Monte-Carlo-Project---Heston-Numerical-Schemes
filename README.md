# Monte-Carlo-Project---Heston-Numerical-Schemes

This paper implements numerical schemes of both low and high order derived from seminal
works in stochastic differential equations (SDEs) approximation: S. Ninomiya and N. Victoir’s
weak approximation method and A. Alfonsi’s high order discretization schemes.
To achieve this, we rely on the following articles: ”Weak approximation of stochastic differential
equations and application to derivative pricing” and ”High order discretization schemes
for the CIR process: application to affine term structure and Heston models”. The aim is
to implement the numerical scheme introduced in these articles for pricing in the Heston model.
Comparative analysis includes the Euler scheme alongside various variance reduction techniques.
This research aims also to evaluate the efficacy of these schemes in accurately pricing derivatives.
Key findings are expected to contribute to enhancing computational efficiency and accuracy in
derivative pricing.
